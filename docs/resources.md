# Resources for VocabSieve

VocabSieve supports a range of different local resources, which you can use without an internet connection. 
## Supported files
- StarDict, the most commonly available free dictionary format online
- Migaku (.json)
- JSON (.json, plain key-value pairs)
- CSV
- DSL
- MDX
    > {: .note}
    MDX dictionaries are often in heavy HTML format for style, but VocabSieve can only handle text-based definitions. They are converted into text before being shown, which may not always work well.
- JSON frequency lists (as a simple list of words in json format) 
- Sound libraries (a directory of audio files)

## StarDict


### Hu Zheng (StarDict author) personal website, over 100 dictionaries

<http://download.huzheng.org/>

### Russian Wiktionary Exports (Multiple languages with definitions in Russian)

<http://libredict.org/en/> (Might have formatting issues)

### English Wiktionary Exports

<http://www.dictinfo.com/> (Disclaimer: Not tested by author)

### GTongue Dictionaries

<https://sites.google.com/site/gtonguedict/home/stardict-dictionaries>

<https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6093047> (Torrent)

<https://mega.nz/folder/Ll0wxYqa#2YLA7IHZhRZEfGHyZNqGdw> (MEGA)

### Wiktionary for eBook Readers, also available in StarDict

<https://github.com/BoboTiG/ebook-reader-dict>

## Migaku

Migaku Official MEGA Folder, 11 languages

<https://mega.nz/folder/eyYwyIgY#3q4XQ3BhdvkFg9KsPe5avw/folder/bz4ywa5A>

## Simple JSONs

{: .note}
This is mainly meant for technical users to create their own dictionaries. This is the easiest format to create, as you simply make a big json file with keys for the words and values for definitions.

### English Wiktionary for Russian words, ~400k entries

<https://freelanguagetools.org/wikt-kaikki-ru.json>

This file is produced from Kaikki’s Wiktionary dumps. It should produce results very similar to using the default Wiktionary (English) option without using the internet. I may create similar files for other languages at a later date and/or if there is a demand for it. If you need a such a file, message me on the chatroom linked on the sidebar.

## Lingvo DSL

{: .note}
Support for DSL has been added in version 0.8. It is not fully mature but should work with most dictionaries. Report any issues to Github or the chat group.
