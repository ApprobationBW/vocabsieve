# Configuration

{: .note}
Before opening the configuration panel, it is recommended to have Anki with AnkiConnect installed open so you can access all settings. If you did not do this before first opening VocabSieve, you can just close the configuration window and open it again by pressing the button on the bottom of the window after you started Anki.

## Generally required settings

VocabSieve is meant to have sane defaults, so that only minimal configuration is required to start using it, but a few things are still necessary. The configuration window will pop up when you first open it. 

1. On the first tab, select a target language from the list.
2. Then, select a dictionary.
    > {: .highlight}
    Use Google translation only if you have no other option. Translations are less detailed than dictionary definitions and may not provide the full range of meanings needed to understand the sentence.
3. You are recommended to leave lemmatization on as it is by default. It can greatly boost dictionary coverage for many languages. The setting is ignored if your language is not supported.

4. Optionally, you can add frequency lists and local dictionary files via the bottom option of "Manage local dictionaries". Consult the [Resources]({{site.baseurl}}/resources.html) page for compatible files. You can always do this later.

5. Go to the "Anki" tab. 

6. Select a deck to add your notes to. 

7. (Generally not required) Select fields to populate with sentence, word, definitions, images, and pronunciation.
    > {: .highlight}
    By default, VocabSieve will generate a new note type for you to be used with the tool to minimize required setup, so the fields should be populated by default. But if you would like to use your own, match the note type and data fields into note fields. To do this you must have a note type with at least three fields, one each for Sentence, Word, and Definition. 

You're done! Now you are ready to mine sentences.
