# Workflows

VocabSieve supports a variety of different workflows. However, they can be broadly separated into two categories, which are termed *synchronous* and *asynchronous* workflows (alternatively, in terms of usage of the software, *interactive* and *non-interactive* modes). In a synchronous workflow, you use VocabSieve *during* your immersion, such as reading or watching a video, while in an asynchronous workflow, you use VocabSieve at some point *after* your immersion session is finished.
