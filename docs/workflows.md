# Workflows

Before setting up and starting to use VocabSieve, it is helpful to consider what your immersion workflow will be with VocabSieve.

VocabSieve supports a variety of different workflows. They can be broadly classified into two categories, which are termed *synchronous* and *asynchronous* workflows (alternatively, in terms of usage of the software, *interactive* and *non-interactive* modes). In a synchronous workflow, you use VocabSieve *during* your immersion, such as reading or watching a video, while in an asynchronous workflow, you use VocabSieve at some point *after* your immersion session is finished.

## Synchronous workflows
### Text
#### General

When you see any sentence from anywhere, you can simply copy it to the clipboard. It will appear on the Sentence field right away. Then, double click on any word. A definition should appear if found. You can look up words from the Definition field too. Then, when you are satisfied with the data, click on Add Note button to send it to Anki. You can add tags just like in Anki.

**Note**: It seems that on MacOS clipboard change may not always be detected due to OS restrictions. In that case simply use the "Read clipboard" button.

#### Browser

When you turn on the extension, you will notice that sentences are underlined in green. Whenever you click on any word, VocabSieve will receive both the whole sentence and the word under your cursor. The word will be looked up immediately too. Chances are, with lemmatization on, this is exactly the word you want. In that case, just press Ctrl/Cmd + S to save the card, and you can keep reading!

### Video

#### mpv

You can use this tool in combination with [mpv](https://mpv.io) with the [mpvacious plugin](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious) to make it copy subtitles to clipboard continuously. Then, you can use the Ctrl-m hotkey to add the media (screenshot and audio) afterwards. For details, check the documentation for mpvacious.

#### asbplayer

You can use VocabSieve as a dictionary tool with [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer). For details, check the documentation for mpvacious. You can also refer to this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXO4gmCmcNE) from Refold.
